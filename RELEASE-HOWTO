Description of the new release procedure
----------------------------------------

1. Update version number in ./lib/mpdaf/version.py, removing the .dev suffix.

2. Update changelog, update version number and date.

3. Run tests and build documentation to make sure that everything is ok.

4. Commit and push.

5. When Gitlab-CI is happy, tag the version and push tags (git push --tags).

6. Create the sdist archive, from a clean tree:

    git clean -fxd .
    python setup.py build sdist

7. Install the sdist archive in a fresh virtualenv and run tests.

    virtualenv test-new-version
    source test-new-version/bin/activate
    pip install dist/mpdaf-3.0.tar.gz
    pip install pytest
    python -c "import mpdaf; print(mpdaf.__file__)"
    pytest $(dirname $(python -c "import mpdaf; print(mpdaf.__file__)"))

8. Upload the sdist archive to PyPI:

    pip install twine
    twine upload -u <username> dist/*

9. Build the binary wheels.
   On https://github.com/musevlt/mpdaf-wheels, edit MPDAF_VERSION in the
   .travis.yml file, commit and push. Then wheels should be build on
   https://travis-ci.org/musevlt/mpdaf-wheels and uploaded to
   https://github.com/musevlt/mpdaf-wheels/releases if it was successful.
   Download the wheels, and push them to PyPI with twine.

10. Prepare the next version: increase version number in ./lib/mpdaf/version.py
    and add the .dev suffix, and the same in the changelog.
