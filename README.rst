MPDAF, the *MUSE Python Data Analysis Framework*, is a Python package developed
and maintained by `CRAL <https://cral.univ-lyon1.fr/>`_, for the analysis of
MUSE data in the context of the GTO.

It contains a list of Python classes and functions to play with MUSE specific
objects (raw data, pixel tables, etc.) and spectra, images and data cubes.

A `Gitlab <https://git-cral.univ-lyon1.fr/MUSE/mpdaf>`_ instance is used for
development, download and tickets.
